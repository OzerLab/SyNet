# SyNet
Object Detection with Ensemble Networks
A combination method, SyNet, is proposed in this work which combines multi-stage detectors with single-stage ones with the motivation of decreasing the high false negative rate of multi-stage detectors and increasing the quality of the single-stage detector proposals. As building blocks, CenterNet and Cascade R-CNN with pretrained feature extractors are utilized along with an ensembling method.
